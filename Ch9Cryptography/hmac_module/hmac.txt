The HMAC algorithm can be used to verify the integrity of information passed between
applications or stored in a potentially vulnerable location. The basic idea is to generate
a cryptographic hash of the actual data combined with a shared secret key. The resulting
hash can then be used to check the transmitted or stored message to determine a level of
trust, without transmitting the secret key.
