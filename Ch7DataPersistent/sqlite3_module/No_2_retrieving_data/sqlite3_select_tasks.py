To retrieve the values saved in the task table from within a Python program, create a
Cursor from a database connection. A cursor produces a consistent view of the data, and
is the primary means of interacting with a transactional database system like SQLite.

"""
Querying is a two-step process. First, run the query with the cursorâ€™s execute() method
to tell the database engine which data to collect. Then, use fetchall() to retrieve the
results. The return value is a sequence of tuples containing the values for the columns
included in the select clause of the query.
