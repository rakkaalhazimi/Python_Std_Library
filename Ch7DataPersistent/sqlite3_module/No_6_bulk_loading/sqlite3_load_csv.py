To apply the same SQL instruction to a large set of data, use executemany(). This method
is useful for loading data, since it avoids looping over the inputs in Python and lets the
underlying library apply loop optimizations. This example program reads a list of tasks
from a comma-separated value file using the csv (page 466) module and loads them into
the database.
