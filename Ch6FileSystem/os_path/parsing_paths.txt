Path parsing depends on a few variables defined in os (page 1227):
• os.sep: The separator between portions of the path (e.g., “/” or “\”).
• os.extsep: The separator between a filename and the file “extension” (e.g., “.”).
• os.pardir: The path component that means traverse the directory tree up one level (e.g., “..”).
• os.curdir: The path component that refers to the current directory (e.g., “.”).
